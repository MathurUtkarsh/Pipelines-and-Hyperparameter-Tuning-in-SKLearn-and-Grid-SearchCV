# Pipelines and Hyperparameter Tuning in SKLearn and Grid SearchCV

Pipelines and hyperparameter tuning are important techniques in machine learning that can help improve the performance of models.

In scikit-learn (sklearn), a pipeline is a sequence of transformers and a final estimator. The pipeline allows for the application of multiple transformations to the data before the final estimator is applied. This can make it easier to work with multiple preprocessing steps and different models.

Hyperparameter tuning, also known as model selection, is the process of selecting the best set of hyperparameters for a given model. One common technique for hyperparameter tuning in scikit-learn is GridSearchCV.

GridSearchCV is an sklearn class that can be used to perform an exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid. The class takes an estimator (such as a classifier or regressor), a parameter grid, and a scoring function as inputs. It then fits the estimator to the data using a set of parameters from the grid and returns the set of parameters that yielded the best performance according to the scoring function.

For example, to tune the hyperparameters of a Random Forest classifier using GridSearchCV, we would first define the parameter grid, containing the range of values for each hyperparameter we want to optimize, such as the number of estimators, maximum depth of the tree, and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Next, we create an instance of the RandomForestClassifier class and an instance of the GridSearchCV class, passing the estimator, parameter grid, and scoring function as arguments. Finally, we fit the GridSearchCV object to the training data and it will return the best set of hyperparameters.

It's worth noting that GridSearchCV can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets and/or complex models, and alternatives like RandomizedSearchCV or Bayesian Optimization can be used for this task.
